1. If you haven't already, install
	Python3.x
with the following extra modules
	tkinter
	serial
	math
	matplotlib
	time
	datetime

Also download the latest Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software 

2)
Your kits include:
1 Arduino, brand new
1 cable USB to USB-B
1 breadboard with tre-pin thermo sensor and 4.7kOhm pull-up resistor
1 Ultrasonic range sensor
1 9V battery connector
1 servo, with assortment of actuator arms and screws
8 connector wires, male-male

handed out separately:
9V battery
1 Big Clear LED, w red light. This can be driven directly from Arduino GPIO outputs. The long pin goes to positive and the negative to GND. Don't connect directly to "5V", though...
1 photo transistor LTR-4206E

14 of the kits also include 
1 breadboard w L293D quad half-H driver (double bidirectional motor driver, but we only use "left" side), https://goo.gl/images/KKQFkw 

Breadboards work like this:

3) Agenda 
*) installation
*) getting basic serial communication working, set LED from python 
*) sensor data into python
*) more power for driving motors. Wiring 

4) Creative Tinker time! Suggestions:
*) Adding servo function to existing buttons.
*) adding or modifying buttons.
*) adding charts w same data (scaling? average?)
